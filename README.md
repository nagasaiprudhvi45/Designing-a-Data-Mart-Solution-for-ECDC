This project entails the design of a data mart solution for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to monitor the daily number of new reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) cases, and vaccination progress across the EU/EEA area.
Solution Highlights:
Data Sources: Integration of various data sources providing COVID-19 statistics and vaccination data across EU/EEA.
Data Modeling: Designing a robust data model to represent COVID-19 cases, deaths, ICU admissions, and vaccination progress.
Aggregation: Aggregating data by region, country, and time period to answer specific queries effectively.
Performance Optimization: Implementing indexing and other performance optimization techniques for efficient query processing.
Reporting: Generating reports for frequent queries posed by ECDC managers, including regional and national statistics for COVID-19 and vaccination.
Data Visualization: Utilizing data visualization techniques to present insights in a clear and intuitive manner.
